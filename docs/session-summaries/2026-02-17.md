## What We Worked On

Session start. Reviewing project state after yesterday's Phase 5 completion. Investigating iPhone LAN access regression. Setting up Obsidian vault with session-summaries structure.

---

## Context Carried Forward

From 2026-02-16 session:
- Phase 5 complete (4/4 plans)
- Phase 6 is next: background processing pipeline + flashcard study mode
- **Open issue:** LLM speed (60-90s per entry) must be solved via background processing
- **iPhone access:** Was working via `http://192.168.1.10:5173`, then failed

---

## iPhone Access Investigation

### Symptoms
- Previously reachable from iPhone on LAN via Mac Studio IP
- Failed after end of session

### Likely Causes to Check
1. **Vite dev server not running** — `npm run dev` must be active
2. **IP address changed** — Mac Studio may have gotten new DHCP lease; check `ifconfig | grep 192`
3. **allowedHosts mismatch** — `vite.config.ts` hardcodes `192.168.1.10`; if IP changed, Vite will reject the connection with 403
4. **macOS firewall** — System Settings → Network → Firewall may be blocking port 5173

### Config as-of This Session
`frontend/vite.config.ts` allowedHosts:
```
localhost, 192.168.1.10, macstudio, mac-studio, mac-studio.local, hagelbg.dyndns-ip.com
```

### Fix Options
- Confirm current IP: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
- If IP changed: update `allowedHosts` in `vite.config.ts`
- For stability: set static IP on Mac Studio in System Settings → Network

## Accomplishments

### ✅ Obsidian Vault Initialized
- Created `docs/session-summaries/` structure
- Created `_template.md` for future sessions
- Migrated 2026-02-16 session summary into vault
- This file: first native vault session entry

## Phase Status

**Phase 6 — Flashcards & Basic Study:** Not started (planning phase)

Background processing work (untracked files from git status):
- `exception/` package — new exception classes
- `llm/translation/` — Google Translate integration
- `BackgroundProcessingService.java`
- `V3__add_background_processing.sql`
- `V4__add_inflection_difficulty.sql`
- `frontend/src/utils/`

These suggest Phase 6 background processing work was started but not committed.

---

## Current GSD Position

```
Phase:  6 of 8 (ready to plan/execute)
Plan:   No plans started for Phase 6
Status: Resuming — need to assess uncommitted Phase 6 work
```

**Next action:** Review uncommitted files, assess what's already been built toward Phase 6, then plan forward.
